Please follow the code conventions written in this file for this project.

This codebase follows the Oracle "Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language".  See the following link:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconvtoc-136057.html

- No warnings allowed, but be as specific as possible with warning suppression

- Prefer to avoid abbreviations when reasonable (i.e. 'msg' vs 'message')

- Static variable names should be entirely capitalized and seperated by '_'
  (i.e. private static int FOO_BAR_BAR = 2)

- Non-static variable and method names should not begin capitalized and should only use
  alphanumeric characters (i.e. int fooBarBar)

- All classnames begin capitalized then use lower casing (i.e. class FooBarBar)

- All while/if/else must have brackets, even if there there is only a one
  line statement following.  'else' and 'else if' are expected to line up
  with the '}'.  For example:

if (condition) {
  statement;
}

if (condition) {
  statement;
} else {
  statement;
}
