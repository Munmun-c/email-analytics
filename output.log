The optional headlight fairing and radiator/engine cowling were\noptions offered by the manufacturer (Honda).  The previous owner purchased the\nitems and installed them on the bike. They dress the bike up and give it a more\nracey/cafe bike type look.   The bike has the factory paint job and stickers.\nThe base color is white, and the decals are light blue and light mauve.  I work\n2 jobs, so I\u0027m pretty much out of pocket during the weekdays. I work my 2nd job\nat night and I can\u0027t dial long distance; however, if you\u0027d like to call me one\nevening I can be reached at 901 397-4587 after 6:00 p.m. weekdays.

When you say it has the optional headlight\n\u003e fairing, etc., does that mean they are not on the bike? What color is the\n\u003e bike? Do you have a number I can reach you at so we can discuss it further?\n\u003e I am very interested and would like to see what we can work out. I need to\n\u003e know what city and zip code the bike is in to find out how much it would be\n\u003e to ship it.

I hate to part with it, but I\u0027m trying to raise\n\u003e    capital to fund a business venture.  I don\u0027t have any pictures of it,\n\u003e    but I can borrow my girlfriends digital camera and get you some;\n\u003e    however, I won\u0027t see her until this friday (11/30), and we are heading\n\u003e    out of town until 12/4.  I\u0027ll try to see if I can do anything before\n\u003e    then, but I can\u0027t say for sure, as I don\u0027t own a computer or any\n\u003e    computer equipment.  I only have computer access at my job.  In\n\u003e    reference to shipping cost to Texas, shipping company\u0027s usually charge\n\u003e    by size, weight, and distance travelled.  The bike doesn\u0027t weigh that\n\u003e    much, but you\u0027d probably have to check with a truck line to verify a\n\u003e    freight prices.  In regard to the title, I do have the title, but\n\u003e    it\u0027s still in the person\u0027s name that I purchased the bike from.  He had\n\u003e    it licensed, with tags on it, and rode it on the street.  I bought it\n\u003e    just as a pit/play bike.  I take it to local motorcycle races on a\n\u003e    trailer as a pit bike and ride it around my neighborhood, so I never\n\u003e    licensed it to keep from paying sales tax.  If it becomes an issue, I\n\u003e    can retitle it in my name. The unit has somewhere around 980 miles on\n\u003e    it, and it has the optional headlight fairing and engine/radiator\n\u003e    shroud/cowl.  The only thing that I did to it when I bought it was\n\u003e    change all the fluids, lube, check everything over and adjust things as\n\u003e    needed.  Let me know if you have any further questions or need more\n\u003e    info.\n\u003e\n\u003e    Thx.\n\u003e\n\u003e    Greg Rowe\n\u003e\n\u003e    \"Harris, Steven\" wrote:\n\u003e\n\u003e    \u003e Do you still have the bike for sale?

Furthermore, prices continued to erode during last night\u0027s Access and closed at 2.775.  Currently, JAN 02 is trading at 2.680 on its expiry, and FEB 02 is trading at 2.700.  \n\nWith the inability of the prompt to close \u003e 2.960, and a subsequent sharp drop in prices, it is logical to infer that 3.050 was definitely a short to intermediate term top. What this means is if the move from 3.440 to 2.180 was an A wave down (a 1.260 decline), and the move from 2.180 to 3.050 was the B wave up, then the downside targets (C wave down) are 2.270 (.618 of A\u003dC) and 1.790 (A\u003dC).","Date":"Thu Dec 27 22:26:09 IST 2001","EpochTimeStamp":0,"Sentiment":"5","Topic":"business"}
